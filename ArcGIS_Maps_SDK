I have been using ArcGIS API for JavaScript since 2015. It is a very good GIS libary for the developers to implement GIS elements and mapping functions during the Web GIS app develepment.

Esri now changes the name of "ArcGIS API for JavaScript" to "ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript".

I used the ArcGIS JavaScript API 3 version at the beginning, and now I am starting to use ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.X version. There are dramatricilly changes between 3.X and 4.X versions.

I put what I have been leanring in ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript 4.X in this project folder.
